        <p>Oscars is the prom for film obsessives. There are many homecomings and dances leading up to the ceremony but nothing that can compare to the pomp and artifice of the Oscars.
        There are the dresses, the speeches and the in memoriam but the big sport in film journalism is what will be nominated for Oscar Best Picture.
        I participate every year with my friends and my colleagues and I am generally wrong. However, this year, I think I am right. What follows are what I am predicting will be nominated for Best Picture, ranked on the likelihood of them getting multiple nominations:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Sinners (director: Ryan Coogler)</li>
        <li>Hamnet (director: Chloe Zhao)</li> 
       <li> It was Just an Accident (dir. Jafar Panahi)</li>
        <li>Sentimental Value (dir. Joachim Trier)</li>
        </ol>
